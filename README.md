# Blog-site ( No database)

This is a simple blog site without a database, it has server code written in node and express and most html content written using ejs files.

## Functions

It doesnt have a lot fancy functions you can write and edit you can view all th titles and click on them to see the content. Thats about it.

Due to the lack of a database when i restart the server all the blogs written will be lost forever
